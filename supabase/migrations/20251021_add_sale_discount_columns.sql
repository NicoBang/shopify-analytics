-- Add separate columns for order discounts and sale discounts
-- This allows us to distinguish between:
-- 1. Order-level discounts (discount codes, automatic discounts) -> order_discount_total
-- 2. Sale/campaign discounts (compareAtPrice - price) -> sale_discount_total
--
-- Previously: only had total_discounts = order_discount + sale_discount combined
-- Now: track them separately for accurate bruttooms√¶tning calculation
