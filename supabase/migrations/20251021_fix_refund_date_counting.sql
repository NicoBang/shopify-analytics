-- Fix: Count refunds by refund_date instead of created_at_original
-- This ensures refunds are counted in the period they actually happened
-- NOT in the period the original order was created

-- Re-aggregate ALL historical data with correct refund counting logic
-- This will take ~2-5 minutes for full historical data
